# PRODIGY_DS_02

In this project loads the data using pandas then used the dataframe and methods like head(),tail(),info(),describe() to understand 
the structure of the data in that dataset eventually performing the data cleaning process.
Finally, performed the EDA to visualize the data which also helped to understand the data better for advanced modelling or analysis.
Seaborn,Matplotlib module was used which included methods like show(),title(),histplot(),barplot(),countplot(),heatmap() and many more.
